# Quickstart

Quickly get started with cross-posting your content on social media. {{ className: 'lead' }}

In this guide, we’ll connect to a Threads account and create a post for the account.

## Connect your social account

For this example, we’ll connect a Threads account via the dashboard.

<Tip>
  You can connect accounts via the API—see the [API method for connecting accounts](/docs/connecting-accounts#api-method) guide for more information.
</Tip>

Visit the [integrations](/integrations) page and click **Connect an account**, select **Threads**, and press **Connect**.

Follow the instructions from Threads to connect your account.

Once you’ve successfully connected your account, navigate to the [connections](/connections) page and find your account in the list and copy the connection ID.

## Post to your social account

You’ll need your API key from the [dashboard](/keys) to access the API.

There is a single endpoint for posting to all platforms, but to just post to Threads, you can use the following example:

<CodeGroup tag="POST" label="/v1/publish">

```bash {{ title: 'cURL' }}
curl -X POST https://sotsial.com/v1/publish \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer {token}" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"targets": ["<my_connection_id>"], "post": {"text": "My first post!"}}'
```

```js
await fetch('https://sotsial.com/v1/publish', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    targets: ['<my_connection_id>'],
    post: { 
      text: 'My first post!',
    },
  }),
});
```

```python
import requests

requests.post('https://sotsial.com/v1/publish', 
  headers={
    'Authorization': f'Bearer {token}',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
  },
  json={
    target: '<my_connection_id>',
    post: {
      text: 'My first post!',
    },
  },
)
```

</CodeGroup>

**And that’s it!** You’ve made your first post to Threads.

<Warn>
  Some platforms require additional parameters.

  Check out the documentation for each platform you’re posting to.
