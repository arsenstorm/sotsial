# Connecting accounts

You can connect social accounts to Sotsial via the API or the dashboard. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## Dashboard Method

To connect a social account via the dashboard, go to the [integrations](/integrations) page and click **Connect an account**, select the platform you want to connect, and follow the instructions.

<Tip>
  You can connect multiple accounts of the same platform.

You should use this method if you only intend to connect your own accountsâ€”otherwise, you should use the API method.

## API Method

Using the API to connect accounts is most suitable for end-users.

## Your own OAuth

You may also wish to use your own OAuth credentials (such as your own app's Facebook App ID and Secret) to connect accounts.

To do this, you'll need to set up the credential in the dashboard.

<Tip>
  Credentials are not yet fully supported.

  If you need to use your own credentials, please [contact support](https://sotsial.com/help).
