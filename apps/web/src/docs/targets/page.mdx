# Targets

Targets are the way to specify where you want to publish content. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## What is a target?

A target is an identifier that represents either a single connection or a group of connections.

## Targeting connections

There are multiple ways to target connections.

- Using a connection ID
- Using a tag
- Targeting by username

### Using a connection ID

A connection ID is a unique identifier that represents a single connection.

You can view the list of connections you have created in the [connections](/connections) page where you can also copy the connection ID.

### Using a tag

A tag is a way to target connections by a custom identifier.

To set up a tag, you can either:

1. Create a tag in the [connections](/connections) page.
2. Specify tags when creating a grant URL.
3. Set/update/delete tags via the API.

### Targeting by username

You can target connections by username by platform.

For example, if you want to target connections by username on Threads, you would add `threads:<username>` to the `targets` parameter.
